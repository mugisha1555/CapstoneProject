        A keyboard is a portable wired or wireless electronic device that contains all the<br> alphabets, numerics, symbols and special characters,
        which is used for entering input data into <br>a laptop/ desktop computer system.<br> <br>

        Types of Computer Keyboard <br>
        <br>
        Keyboards are classified based on the size and their mode of usage. Those types are discussed below:<br> <br>
       
        
         1. Multimedia Keyboard<br>
         The keyboard that has all multimedia buttons is called multimedia keyboard. The buttons include play, pause, previous, next, volume up, volume down, mute and special button to launch media. Also, a button to launch a browser, my computer, calculator is available.<br> <br>

        2. Mechanical Keyboard <br>
        The primitive keyboard which uses physical buttons for each key is called a mechanical keyboard. It makes noise when each key is pressed. A button is pushed down and an electrical signal is sent to the computer device which then shows the characters.<br> <br>

        3. Wireless Keyboard<br>
        Bluetooth, IR technology or Radio Frequency is used to connect the keyboard with the computer device. We can port the keyboard and the parent system is not needed near the keyboard. These keyboards are lightweight and smaller in size. These keyboards should have a transmitter and trans-receiver. Transmitter sends the strokes from the keyboard as radio waves which are received by trans-receiver kept near parent device.<br> <br>

        4. Virtual Keyboard<br>
        The keyboard used in smartphones is called a virtual keyboard. This keyboard appears when needed and disappears when typing is completed. This can be automatically set as per need. Also in the windows system, we can use a virtual keyboard that appears on the screen. There is no physical object to carry for a virtual keyboard.<br> <br>

        5. USB Keyboard<br>
        Universal Serial Bus Keyboard has a USB stick with a wire which has to be inserted into the USB port of the system. And then the keyboard works well. While rebooting the system, the keyboard is not supported and hence the users may face an issue. Installation of suitable drivers helps to resolve this issue.<br> <br>

        6. Ergonomic Keyboard <br>
          This keyboard is mainly designed for users who use both hands for typing. The advantage of this keyboard is less muscle strain and carpal tunnel syndrome for users. The keyboard is built with the view of ergonomics. This keyboard is expensive and not affordable for common people.<br> <br>
